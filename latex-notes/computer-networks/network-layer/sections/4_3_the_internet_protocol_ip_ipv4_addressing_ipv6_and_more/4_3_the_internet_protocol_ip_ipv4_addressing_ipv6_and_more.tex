\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delves into foundational protocols and addressing schemes of the Internet Protocol (IP) that enable the Internet's network layer.
    \item IP Protocol provides essential, unreliable, best-effort delviery service that underpins all higher-layer communcation
    \item IP Protocol is hte only network-layuer protocol used in the Internet
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{IP Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the only network-layer protocol in the internet
    \item Is the "narrow waist" of the hourglass, the single protocol that everything else - every transport protocol (TCP, UDP) and every applciaiton (HTTP, DNS) - must run on top of
    \item In turn must be able to run over any link-layer technology (Ethernet, WiFi, 4G, etc)
\end{itemize}
