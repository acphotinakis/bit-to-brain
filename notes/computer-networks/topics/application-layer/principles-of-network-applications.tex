\section{Application Layer Overview}

\subsection{Overview}
Goal of this is to introduce the application layer of the Internet protocol stack: its goals, common application-layer protocols such as HTTP, SMTP/IMAP, DNS, P2P, streaming/CDNs, and practical programming considerations (socket API, UDP/TCP).
Here we'll contrast application-level requirements with transport services (TCP vs UDP) and touches on security (TLS).


\subsection{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand conceptual and implementation aspects of application-layer protocols
    \item Study transport-layer service models
    \item Learn client-server and peer-to-peer paradigms
    \item Examine popular application-layer protocols:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item HTTP (Web)
              \item SMTP, IMAP (Email)
              \item DNS (Domain Name System)
          \end{itemize}
    \item Study video streaming systems and CDNs
    \item Learn socket programming with UDP and TCP
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{[Summary: The application layer focuses on network applications, their protocols, and how they use underlying transport services. Key paradigms include client-server and P2P architectures.]}

\section{Network Applications and Paradigms}

\subsection{Common Network Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Social networking
    \item Web browsing
    \item Text messaging
    \item Email
    \item Multi-user network games
    \item Streaming stored video (YouTube, Hulu, Netflix)
    \item P2P file sharing
    \item Voice over IP (Skype)
    \item Real-time video conferencing (Zoom)
    \item Internet search
    \item Remote login
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{orange}{[Mnemonic: WESTS - Web, Email, Streaming, Texting, Social - covers major application categories]}

\subsection{Creating Network Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Programs run on different end systems
    \item Communication occurs over network
    \item Example: web server software communicates with browser software
    \item \textbf{Key Insight}: No need to write software for network-core devices
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Network-core devices don't run user applications
              \item Applications reside only on end systems
              \item Enables rapid application development and propagation
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Network Application Architecture: Applications run on end systems using the protocol stack}
    \label{fig:network-arch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Client-Server Paradigm}


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Server}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Always-on host
              \item Permanent IP address
              \item Waits for and serves client requests
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clients}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Contact and communicate with server
              \item May be intermittently connected
              \item May have dynamic IP addresses
              \item Do not communicate directly with each other
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Examples}: HTTP, IMAP, FTP
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{[Summary: Client-server model features dedicated servers that are always available and multiple clients that initiate connections. This is the foundation of most traditional web services.]}

\subsection{Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item No always-on server
    \item Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
    \item Peers both request and provide services
    \item \textbf{Key Advantages}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Self-scalability: New peers bring new service capacity
              \item Distributed nature reduces single points of failure
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Challenges}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Peers are intermittently connected
              \item Peers change IP addresses
              \item Complex management and coordination
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Example}: P2P file sharing (BitTorrent)
\end{itemize}

\section{Process Communication and Sockets}

\subsection{Processes Communicating}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Process}: Program running within a host
    \item \textbf{Client process}: Process that initiates communication
    \item \textbf{Server process}: Process that waits to be contacted
    \item Processes on same host use inter-process communication (IPC)
    \item Processes on different hosts communicate by exchanging messages
    \item Note: P2P applications have both client and server processes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sockets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
    \item \textbf{Analogy}: Socket is like a door
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Sending process shoves message out the door
              \item Transport infrastructure delivers message to receiving process's socket
          \end{itemize}
    \item Two sockets involved: one on each communicating process
    \item \textbf{Developer Control}: Application developer controls application layer
    \item \textbf{OS Control}: Operating system controls transport layer and below
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm]
        \node (app1) [rectangle, draw, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm] {Application Process};
        \node (socket1) [rectangle, draw, below=0.5cm of app1, minimum width=2cm] {Socket};
        \node (transport1) [rectangle, draw, below=0.5cm of socket1, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=0.8cm] {Transport Network Link Physical};

        \node (app2) [rectangle, draw, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, right=4cm of app1] {Application Process};
        \node (socket2) [rectangle, draw, below=0.5cm of app2, minimum width=2cm] {Socket};
        \node (transport2) [rectangle, draw, below=0.5cm of socket2, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=0.8cm] {Transport Network Link Physical};

        \node (internet) [cloud, draw, aspect=2, below=1cm of socket1] {Internet};

        \draw [<->] (socket1.south) -- (transport1.north);
        \draw [<->] (socket2.south) -- (transport2.north);
        \draw [<->] (transport1.south) -- (internet.north);
        \draw [<->] (transport2.south) -- (internet.south);

        \node [left=0.1cm of app1] {\scriptsize Controlled by app developer};
        \node [left=0.1cm of transport1] {\scriptsize Controlled by OS};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Socket Communication: Applications use sockets as interface to network services}
    \label{fig:socket-comm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Addressing Processes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To receive messages, process must have an identifier
    \item Host has unique 32-bit IP address
    \item IP address alone is insufficient - many processes can run on same host
    \item Complete identifier includes: IP address + port numbers
    \item \textbf{Common Port Numbers}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item HTTP server: port 80
              \item Mail server: port 25
              \item Example: Sending HTTP to gaia.cs.umass.edu
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item IP address: 128.119.245.12
                        \item Port number: 80
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{[Summary: Processes communicate through sockets, which act as endpoints. Addressing requires both IP address and port number to uniquely identify applications on hosts.]}

\section{Application-Layer Protocols}

\subsection{Protocol Definition}
An application-layer protocol defines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Types of messages exchanged}: Request, response messages
    \item \textbf{Message syntax}: Fields and how they are delineated
    \item \textbf{Message semantics}: Meaning of information in fields
    \item \textbf{Rules}: When and how processes send and respond to messages
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol Types}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Protocols}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Defined in RFCs (Request for Comments)
              \item Everyone has access to protocol definition
              \item Enables interoperability
              \item Examples: HTTP, SMTP
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proprietary Protocols}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Privately owned and controlled
              \item May provide competitive advantages
              \item Examples: Skype, Zoom
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{orange}{[Mnemonic: SSTR - Syntax, Semantics, Timing, Rules - the four components of protocols]}

\section{Transport Service Requirements}

\subsection{Application Needs}
Different applications have different transport service requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Some apps require 100\% reliable data transfer (file transfer, web transactions)
              \item Other apps can tolerate some loss (audio)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Throughput}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Some apps require minimum throughput (multimedia)
              \item Other apps are elastic (use whatever throughput available)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timing}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Some apps require low delay (Internet telephony, interactive games)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security}: Encryption, data integrity, authentication
\end{itemize}

    \label{tab:app-requirements}
\end{table}

\textcolor{blue}{[Summary: Applications have varying requirements for data integrity, throughput, and timing. Real-time applications tolerate some loss but need low delay, while data transfer applications require reliability but can tolerate delay.]}

\section{Internet Transport Protocols}

\subsection{TCP Service}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reliable transport} between sending and receiving process
    \item \textbf{Flow control}: Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver
    \item \textbf{Congestion control}: Throttles sender when network overloaded
    \item \textbf{Connection-oriented}: Setup required between client and server
    \item \textbf{Does not provide}: Timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
\end{itemize}

\subsection{UDP Service}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unreliable data transfer} between processes
    \item \textbf{Does not provide}: Reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Q: Why bother with UDP? Why is there a UDP?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower overhead than TCP
    \item No connection establishment delay
    \item Simpler header and no congestion control overhead
    \item Suitable for applications that can tolerate some loss but need low latency
    \item Applications can implement their own reliability if needed
\end{itemize}

\section{Transport Layer Security (TLS)}

\subsection{Security in TCP/UDP}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vanilla TCP \& UDP sockets}: No encryption
    \item Cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse Internet in cleartext
    \item Major security vulnerability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transport Layer Security (TLS)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides encrypted TCP connections
    \item Ensures data integrity
    \item Provides end-point authentication
    \item TLS is implemented in application layer
    \item Applications use TLS libraries, which use TCP in turn
    \item Cleartext sent into "socket" traverses Internet encrypted
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{[Summary: TLS provides security for TCP connections by adding encryption, data integrity, and authentication. It's implemented at the application layer but provides transport-layer security services.]}
